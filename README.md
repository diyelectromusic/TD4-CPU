# TD4-CPU

This is a store for my experiments working towards my own version of the TD4 4-bit CPU.

The original can be found here: https://github.com/wuxx/TD4-4BIT-CPU

Details of my own experiments can be found here: https://emalliab.wordpress.com/2025/09/18/td4-4-bit-diy-cpu/

This repository contains the following:
* TD4 CPU: My own version of the TD4 PCB with extra LEDs!
* TD4 Nano: A version using an Arudino Nano in place of the ROM DIP switches.
* Simulator: A TD4 simulator for the Digital Logic Simulator.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at electronics and pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

# Support

I do not offer support for any of these projects, there are provided "as is" (see license).

# Using my pcbs

Any PCBs are developed in KiCad (https://www.kicad.org/) and there should be everything here required to have any of them built should you so wish.  Each project has an "output" directory and that contains all the build files and a combined ZIP file that can be downloaded "raw" and uploaded to your favourite PCB manufacturing site.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to note any additional information in the readme for each project and please read carefully the design and build information from the blog before spending any time or funds on any of these designs as that is where I will have documented my (countless, no doubt) mistakes in the design!

*Please also note: I don't sell PCBs.*
