This is my own implementation of the TD4 4-bit CPU that uses an Arduino Nano instead of DIP switches for the ROM.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**
